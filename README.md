# Logstash AWS Kinesis Input Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-kinesis.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-kinesis)

This is a [AWS Kinesis](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/introduction.html) input plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash). Under the hood uses the [Kinesis Client Library](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-record-processor-implementation-app-java.html).

## Installation

This plugin requires Logstash >= 2.0, and can be installed by Logstash
itself.

```sh
bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-input-kinesis
```

## Usage

```
input {
  kinesis {
    kinesis_stream_name => "my-logging-stream"
    codec => json { }
  }
}
```

### Using with CloudWatch Logs

If you are looking to read a CloudWatch Logs subscription stream, you'll also want to install and configure the [CloudWatch Logs Codec](https://github.com/threadwaste/logstash-codec-cloudwatch_logs).

## Configuration

This are the properties you can configure and what are the default values:

* `application_name`: The name of the application used in DynamoDB for coordination. Only one worker per unique stream partition and application will be actively consuming messages.
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `logstash`
* `kinesis_stream_name`: The Kinesis stream name.
    * **required**: true
* `region`: The AWS region name for Kinesis, DynamoDB and Cloudwatch (if enabled)
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `us-east-1`
* `checkpoint_interval_seconds`: How many seconds between worker checkpoints to DynamoDB. A low value ussually means lower message replay in case of node failure/restart but it increases CPU+network ussage (which increases the AWS costs).
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `60`
* `metrics`: Worker metric tracking. By default this is disabled, set it to "cloudwatch" to enable the cloudwatch integration in the Kinesis Client Library.
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `nil`
* `profile`: The AWS profile name for authentication. This ensures that the `~/.aws/credentials` AWS auth provider is used. By default this is empty and the default chain will be used.
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `""`
* `role_arn`: The AWS role to assume. This can be used, for example, to access a Kinesis stream in a different AWS
account. This role will be assumed after the default credentials or profile credentials are created. By default
this is empty and a role will not be assumed.
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `""`
* `initial_position_in_stream`: The value for initialPositionInStream. Accepts "TRIM_HORIZON" or "LATEST".
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `"TRIM_HORIZON"`

### Additional KCL Settings
* `additional_settings`: The KCL provides several configuration options which can be set in [KinesisClientLibConfiguration](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/amazon-kinesis-client-multilang/src/main/java/software/amazon/kinesis/coordinator/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java). These options are configured via various function calls that all begin with `with`. Some of these functions take complex types, which are not supported. However, you may invoke any one of the `withX()` functions that take a primitive by providing key-value pairs in `snake_case`. For example, to set the dynamodb read and write capacity values, two functions exist, withInitialLeaseTableReadCapacity and withInitialLeaseTableWriteCapacity. To set a value for these, provide a hash of `additional_settings => {"initial_lease_table_read_capacity" => 25, "initial_lease_table_write_capacity" => 100}`
    * **required**: false
    * **default value**: `{}`

## Authentication

This plugin uses the default AWS SDK auth chain, [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html), to determine which credentials the client will use, unless `profile` is set, in which case [ProfileCredentialsProvider](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/profile/ProfileCredentialsProvider.html) is used.

The default chain follows this order trying to read the credentials:
 * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables
 * `~/.aws/credentials` credentials file
 * EC2 instance profile

The credentials will need access to the following services:
* AWS Kinesis
* AWS DynamoDB: the client library stores information for worker coordination in DynamoDB (offsets and active worker per partition)
* AWS CloudWatch: if the metrics are enabled the credentials need CloudWatch update permisions granted.

Look at the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) for deeper information on the default chain.
